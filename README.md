# ICS 208 Final GUI Project

This was my final project for the grade 10 computer course. I created a program to play[Abalone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game)) using Java Swing. 

In order to play the game, you must have Java installed. 
From this folder, type terminal `java main` in your terminal to launch the game.
